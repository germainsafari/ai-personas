However, what I see as a promising addition to the workflow would be a centralized hub—a platform that allows seamless storage and access to all files and client folders in one place. Ideally, this hub would include a powerful file search function, making it much easier to locate documents quickly.

Additionally, I see great potential in tools that can assist with formula generation and automatically enhance charts and tables—not only improving their visual appeal but also ensuring they are clear and easy to interpret.","In a world increasingly driven by AI, it feels counterintuitive that I still need to manually log hours in tools like Jira and HR Nest, update my status in Slack, and set up out-of-office messages individually. These repetitive administrative tasks are time-consuming and easy to forget, especially for someone like me who has a natural reluctance to performing routine, manual actions.

There’s a clear opportunity for automation here. Ideally, I should be able to mark myself as OOO in one tool, and have that information automatically synced across all relevant platforms—Slack, email, time-tracking, calendars, and project management tools.

Additionally, the process of organizing handovers could be much more efficient with AI support. For example, AI could provide handover templates, suggest relevant Jira tickets, and fetch necessary links and context, helping ensure smooth transitions with minimal effort.","Yeah, I think I know:)","I'm still not entirely sure which AI tools are officially allowed in our workflow or to what extent I should rely on them. At times, I feel that I should try to solve problems on my own, even if the outcome is less polished than what AI could provide. There's something valuable in that process—it’s personal, it’s imperfect, but it helps me learn, grow, and express my individual voice.

Interestingly, I’ve noticed that some of my own drafts—whether it’s an email, a report, or a presentation—might be flawed, but they carry a human touch that resonates differently. That feeling of ownership is important to me. On the other hand, I sometimes wonder if I’m being too hard on myself for using AI—maybe I shouldn’t feel ashamed about leaning on technology that’s designed to help.

That said, interacting with AI also has its quirks. Occasionally, I find myself falling into a rabbit hole, going back and forth in long conversations with the tool. While it can be stimulating, it can also become a distraction if not managed carefully.",Not 100%,"I’m sure AI tools have brought a lot of value, but in my area of collaboration with the client, I haven’t necessarily needed detailed knowledge about their AI usage. That said, I can often tell which tools they’re using—sometimes it’s quite obvious. It brings me back to the realization that I genuinely try to use AI responsibly.

I never generate content, templates, or emails in a single click. I take the time to adjust and refine everything so it expresses exactly what I want to say, in the tone that fits the context and the relationship. For me, it’s about enhancing—not replacing—my own thinking.

That being said… I can sometimes tell when a client used AI to generate content and just left it as-is—with no shame at all! (And honestly, sometimes it’s even a bit charming.)",No.,"When it comes to organizing emails, generating reports, working with Excel formulas, or filling in administrative tools like HR Nest and Jira, I definitely see the value of AI. These are the tasks I’d love to offload to a smart assistant, freeing up my time and mental space for more creative and strategic thinking.

Sometimes, using tools like Outlook feels like stepping back into the '90s—there’s been little evolution in terms of actual user experience or smart integration. Ironically, unless I jot something down in my analog calendar or notebook, I often struggle to mentally process it. There’s something about the physical act of writing that still anchors me.

In my ideal world, I’d like to focus on brain-storming and creative problem solving, while all the admin runs in the background. I imagine an AI assistant that understands the full context of my work—analyzing files, emails, calendars, and documents on my computer—and lets me simply prompt:
""Reply to the client, attach the quote, and log the hours in Jira based on that quote.""

Essentially, I want to act as a team leader to my own computer—giving high-level direction while it executes the details for me.",completed,2025-04-30 11:55:22,,2025-04-30 12:31:11,37faa8e823,

Only tried it out, would have to fine-tune prompting (and educate myself in music genres) to make the effects less generic",,"Hmm I think motion designers dream about the times when adding subtitles or creating multiple language versions of the videos could be fully automated. Or the tasks like editing few-minutes-long videos of people talking, based on the script or client's comments. Or making videos on brand by just replacing certain parts of it. Namely - the very automatic tasks, that in the end are not so easy to automate, as they require jumping between  the document / email / frame.io with clients comments (even if they are straightforward) and the video editing program. I'm not sure how AI could help us here, but intuitively, it sounds like this kind of pain point. 

I think there is also a very ABB-related problem of not having enough footage that shows the products in use and featuring people, as stock cannot provide this (and the consent of using people's faces is problematic). In general, it would be more interesting to work with a less 'generic' and stocky stock footages, and maybe have a bit more fun with this kind of productions (which are our bread and butter). I'm not sure if this is possible to achieve with the content that is ai-generated, maybe not yet, but for sure an alternative for stock would be welcome.
It would be great if we could also art-direct some music production for the videos, rather then be stuck with premiumbeat. Any tools for sound design and music tracks generation for videos would be great. I know Mo already did some research on that, but there is usually some issues with licencing, if we want it for clients.

Besides this, in general, I am curious about the different ways to make my work more productive and organized in a better way. I am a very analog person, and maybe need some guidance there, cause ofc I don't want to fall behind! ;)","Ok, looks like I have already covered it in the previous point, so yes :)",Maybe the ones covered in the first questions of the form?,"Lack of training maybe, or just a bit more time dedicated to applying them in the workflow and discussing this with others.
